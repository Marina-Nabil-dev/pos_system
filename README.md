## Documentation

### Chart.js 
I used Chart.js for visualizing the report data as it is a very popular, well-documented and easy to use library.

### Datatables
I used Datatables for listing the table of purchases as it is a powerful and flexible library that makes it easy to create dynamic tables.

### Bootstrap 5
I used Bootstrap 5 for the summary cards as it is a very popular and well-documented CSS framework. It is easy to use and has a lot of built-in features that make it easy to create visually appealing and responsive UI components.
